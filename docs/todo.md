## Home

- bug: sometimes it's impossible to click on the night-sky in safari...?
- bug: browsers (on iOS) may reload the page without any user input...??
- bug: some mobile browsers add a thin space to the right after using the goto arrow
-- this is probably related to the todo-gate and the overflow-x failings


## Life is too short for this

- use ajax and icons with todo app
- refactor critique views with CBVs
- integrate critique to admin dashboard
- call sqip from photos admin action
- call sqip asynchronously
- clean up photologue custom model
- clear photo cache on slug change or delete
- cache as many pages as possible
