## Features photologue

- add new photosize
-- no auto caching
-- no upscaling
-- no downscaling (use 0 for size?)
- add admin action to generate these sizes on demand
- use slug to name newly created photos (instead of file name; beware of existing cached files)
- create generic css class for images (include borders from 'zoomable' class)


## Features critique

- cache collection view rather than template


## Life is too short for this

- use ajax and icons with todo app
- refactor critique views with CBVs
- integrate critique to admin dashboard
- call sqip asynchronously
- cache as many pages as possible
