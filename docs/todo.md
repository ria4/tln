## Cleaning

- fix dsdu/dedu in fancydate (normalize fields to prefix_du & prefix_mu)
- sort through static and media directories


## CSS tweaks

- span style on oeuvre page


## Features

- all done!


## Long term

- migrate from zinnia to another cms
- bump to django 4.0
    - switch to redis cache
    - update critique collection asynchronously
    - cache much more pages
- refactor critique views with CBVs


## Barely matters

- override admin interfaces to remove useless content
- call sqip asynchronously
- ansible deployment (maybe)
