## Cleaning

- split critique views
- sort through static and media directories


## CSS tweaks

- all done!


## Features

- add form to create `OeuvreSpan`
- show `OeuvreSpan`s on movie pages


## Long term

- blog entry with seances stats & words written
- migrate from zinnia to another cms
- bump to django 4.0
    - switch to redis cache
    - update critique collection asynchronously
    - cache much more pages


## Barely matters

- override admin interfaces to remove useless content
- rework oeuvre_info into oeuvre fields
- refactor critique views with CBVs
- call sqip asynchronously
- ansible deployment (maybe)
