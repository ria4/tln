- bug: some mobile browsers add a thin space to the right after using the goto arrow (this is probably related to the todo-gate and the overflow-x failings)


## Life is too short for this

- use ajax and icons with todo app
- refactor critique views with CBVs
- integrate critique to admin dashboard
- call sqip from photos admin action
- call sqip asynchronously
- clean up photologue custom model
- clear photo cache on slug change or delete
- fix nightsky animation on iphones
- cache as many pages as possible
